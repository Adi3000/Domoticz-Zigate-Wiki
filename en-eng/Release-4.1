## Release 4.1

Even if we are just moving from 4.0.8 , release 4.1 is a pretty important release in terms of functionalities coming on board.
The most important one is with the empowerement of ZIgate firmware 3.0f we are bringing a native support of Groups management.

While using Domoticz groups which operates then device by device, the plugin native group management allow you to create a 
group of devices and to send the same command to all devices of that group at once. Result is a quiet 
responsive Domotic system.

Important efforts have been made to support a number of additional devices and especially remotes controllers as well as some otherss
* Hue remote controller
* Ikea Tradfri remote controller ( 5 buttons and the yellow one)
* Xiaomi Vibration
* Zipato smoke detector
* Hue Motion Sensor

For more information on the certified list of devices, please check 
[List of certified devices](https://github.com/pipiche38/Domoticz-Zigate-Wiki/blob/master/en-eng/Compatible-Devices.md)

Addition work have been also done around the discovery mecanishm in order to speed up the process, but also to handle
as much as possible ZLL and ZHA compliant devices.

## WARNING
Last but not least, we have also restructured the plugin filesystem in order to have a cleaner situation. As a result,
a short migration step needs to performed by yourself, before restarting the plugin.

You'll have to move the file DeviceList-xx from the Domoticz-Zigate (plugin directory) to Domoticz-Zigate/Data ( data plugin directory)
