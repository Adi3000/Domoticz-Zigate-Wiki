# Runnning the plugin under a Windows installation


## Preamble

Most of the developement are done on Linux platform ( Rasbian, Fedora ), and we rely on the python code to run smoothly on Windows platform


## Advices

1. You must run Domoticz with "administrator" privileges in order to create/update files.
1. You might have to disable the "Allow Internet access" parameter which will prevent the plugin for checking if a new version is available
