# Reinstall Plugin and keep Database and Configuration


## Overview

Purpose is to do a re-install of the plugin without loosing any data

You have __critical__ files under the Domoticz-Zigate folder. In case of crash, you might want to have backup to restore. Here after are the files to backup

    Conf/PluginConf-*.json
    Data/*
    Reports/*

Of course you must backup the Domoticz Database `domoticz.db` (check to Domoticz) __at the same time__ in order to have consistency between the two.


## Assumption

* Domoticz plugins are located in ```/home/pi/domoticz/plugins ```
* Zigate plugin has been installed by default under ```/home/pi/domoticz/plugins/Domoticz-Zigate```

In case this is different, please use your own location


## Procedure

1. Stop domoticz

1. Move the Zigate plugin folder to your home directory

   ```mv /home/pi/domoticz/plugins/Domoticz-Zigate   /home/pi```

1. Install the fresh version of the plugin

   ```
   cd /home/pi/domoticz/plugins
   git clone https://github.com/pipiche38/Domoticz-Zigate.git
   ```

1. Copy the Zigate plugin database to the new installation

   ```
   cp /home/pi/Domoticz-Zigate/Data/* /home/pi/domoticz/plugins/Domoticz-Zigate/Data
   ```

1. Copy the Plugin configurations file

   ```
   cp /home/pi/Domoticz-Zigate/Conf/PluginConf* /home/pi/domoticz/plugins/Domoticz-Zigate/Conf
   ```

1. Copy the Plugin reports (if you want to keep the old reports)

   ```
   cp /home/pi/Domoticz-Zigate/Reports/* /home/pi/domoticz/plugins/Domoticz-Zigate/Reports
   ```

   At that stage you have a copy of the Old plugin in /home/pi/Domoticz-Zigate and a new version ready to be launched in ```/home/pi/domoticz/plugins/Domoticz-Zigate```

1. By default you'll be on the 'stable' branch, if you want to switch to 'beta' do

   ```
   cd /home/pi/domoticz/plugins/Domoticz-Zigate/
   git pull
   git checkout beta
   ```

1. You can now restart Domoticz
