## How to pair a device ?
Just turn off/on 6 times your bulb (not with ikea remote, shut off then on power). Your bulb will send a device announce to your zigate, then your zigate will ask some information to your bulb to know wich model it is and add it to Domoticz. If your model is not in DeviceConf.txt it should take a little longer but it will be automatically add as soon as the zigate will have information need foor this.

![Bulb Device](https://github.com/pipiche38/Domoticz-Zigate-Wiki/blob/master/Images/Zigate-Bulb-Device.png)

You should find between 1 and 3 new devices in your Domoticz Device list :

* simple switch, to turn on or off your bulb
* Level Control (LvlControl), to set brigthness level of your bulb
* Color Control (ColorControl), to set color of your bulb


## How to reset the round remote control
4 times (fast) of the pairing button

## How to reset a Bulb
power off few minutes
Then you can simply switch On and it will send a Device Annoucement to start the Pairing process

## How to use the Remote Control 
With Zigate firmware 3.0f you can get the remote control event in domoticz (via a switch selector). In order to do that you must have at least 1 Ikea Bulb, 1 Remote control , 1 Zigate.
* Pair the Ikea Bulb to Zigate, this will create a Switch widget
* Pair the Ikea Remote to Zigate, this will create a Switch selector
* Pair the Ikea Remote with the Ikea Bulb (in order to get them associated , and create a group)
* Enable the Group Management (if not yet done)
  * Let's the plugin do the work and identify the Group created by the Ikea Bulb/Control association
  * You then need to associate the Zigate to this group (see in the Group Management on how to do that )
  
* A step-by-step approach is presented here: https://github.com/pipiche38/Domoticz-Zigate-Wiki/blob/master/en-eng/Ikea-Remote.md

## How to use the tiny Remote switch On/off (squared usally sold with plug )

ATTENTION: 
The switch is controling group 0x0000 (which is usally a group used by Xiaomi plug and switches). 
If you want to ge the Switch events ( On and Off), you'll have to add the Zigate IEEE to the 0x0000 group

1. Paired with Zigate
   
   * This will create a Switch widget on Domoticz and you'll get On and Off event
   
   * To paired the switch with Zigate, press 4 times in 5 secondes when the Zigate and the Plugin are in Permit to Join mode.
   
1. Paired with a device

   * This is the normal setup documented in the Tradfri user manual. You'll paired the remote switch with as much as 10 different devices.
   
   * To paired the switch with a Device, press and hold the pairing button 10s (no more than 5cm of the outlet you want to add )

1. Make sure that Zigate IEEE is member of Group 0000

   * Edit ZigateGroupsConfig-xx.txt and have a similar line
   
   ```
   0000,Groupe 0000, 00158d0001ededde
   ```
   
   Where 00158d0001ededde is the IEEE of Zigate which can be find in the Log or in the Zigate notfication widget .

## How to use the Tradfri Motion sensor

1. Paired with Zigate

   * This will create Motion widget
   * If needed you have to reset the Motion sensor by pressing the pairing button 4 times within 5 secondes
   
1. Paired with a bulb 

   * Hold the motion sensor close too the light source you want to add ( no more than 5cm). Press and hold the pairing button for at least 10 seconds. At the end of the pairing process, the light source will flash one time .
   
From that , every time the motion sensor will turn on the light, you'll get as well the motion widget to On.

You might want to align the Time setting of the Motion sensor with the Reset Time of the Motion widget in Domoticz
