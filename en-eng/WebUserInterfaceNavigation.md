This is a Plugin Dashboard from which you can in a short time if anything else is going wrong on the Zigate environment.
This is some how self explanatory and you have comments for eahc section.
In the header where you have the navigation tabs, you have also a switch which allow you to move Zigate and plugin into Pairing Mode (In case Zigate is already in pairing mode, the switch will automatically enabled).

In the footer (here in Green) you have some quick overview of :
* when the plugin has been started
* a quick plugin status "Ready" here
* the Plugin Version
* the Firmware version on Zigate

The Device Management can be used for 2 purposes:

* To assign a Friendly name to each of your devices, so it will be easier to identify them

* To get more information such as :
  * what are ShortId (Network Address) and IEEE (Mac Address) of the device
  * what is the Model Name
  * what are the Domoticz Widget names attached to this device
  * an Health status
